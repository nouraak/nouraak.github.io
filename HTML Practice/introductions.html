    <h1> Welcome To Our Art Gallery </h1>

    <p>One thing we noticed about the members of group 4, is that we are all great artists. However we were'nt able to showcase our amazing art until now. This website is a place where we can finally show the world our amazing art skills.</p>
    
    <!--second section where we add some quotes-->

    <h2>The Art of <em> Stealing </em></h2>

    <div>William Faulkner once said : <q>Immature artists copy, great artists steal.</q></div>

    <div>Then Pablo Picasso simplified by saying : <q>Good artists copy, great artists steal.</q></div>

    <div>Then came the famous quote by Steve Jobs: <q>Good artists copy, great artists steal.</q></div>

   <!--adding our own Quote in bold and slightly bigger font-->
   <h4><strong><q>Good Artists Copy, Great Artists Steal!</q> ~ Group 4, 2022</strong></h4>

    <h3> About the Artist</h3>

   <!--this is a list with bullet points-->
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name:</strong> Noura Abdelkader</li>
        <li><strong>Age when this was painted:</strong> 10 years old</li>
        <li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> <q>I was a very creative and immaginative child. However I didn't want to do anything productive or anything school related and therefore found a passion in art, since it was a way for me to avoid homework. I drew this painting after I screamed and screamed because my parents wouldn't let me go to my friends house. Yes, that is me in the picture and the dark figures in the background are my parents.</q></li>
